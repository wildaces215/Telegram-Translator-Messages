# Telegram-Translator-Messages
## Inspiration
Since the start of the Russo-Ukraine war I became interested in the plethora of information that has come out in relation to the war itself. There are many different events, people and opinions. Only knowing English I wanted a tool to help me tranlate both what people in Ukraine were saying and in Russia. Thanks to a weird set of circumstances on the information front, there was one app that somehow was used by both Ukrainians and Russians which is Telegram. So taking argos translate an open source translation app and Telethon a Python client for Telegram I created this small app to help people who want to see both sides of the war instead of what you see on the news!
## Getting started
 Run the following command to install the necessary Python packages
 ```
 pip install -r requirements.txt
 ```
 Once that is done then you would want to go to Argos -Translate Website. Once there you would need to download the models that you would want to use. To download and use the models there are two ways of doing this: through the command line and though the gui app itself.
Following installing all the required libraries use or modify it to your liking!
