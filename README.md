# Telegram-Translator-Messages
## Inspiration
Since the start of the Russo-Ukraine war I became interested in the plethora of information that has come out in relation to the war itself. There are many different events, people and opinions. Only knowing English I wanted a tool to help me tranlate both what people in Ukraine were saying and in Russia. Thanks to a weird set of circumstances on the information front, there was one app that somehow was used by both Ukrainians and Russians which is Telegram. So taking argos translate an open source translation app and Telethon a Python client for Telegram I created this small app to help people who want to see both sides of the war instead of what you see on the news!
